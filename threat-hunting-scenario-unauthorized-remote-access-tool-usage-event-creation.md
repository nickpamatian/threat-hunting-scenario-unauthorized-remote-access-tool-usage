# Threat Event (Unauthorized Remote Access Tool Usage)
**Suspicious AnyDesk Execution and Connection Attempt**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the AnyDesk executable: https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe
2. Launch the executable
3. Simulate a connection attempt using a fake ID:  
In the Remote Desk input box, enter: 123 456 789
6. Create a file on your desktop called ```important-documents.txt``` and add some fake entries
7. Move the file to simulate internal staging of exfiltration:  
Copy or move it to: C:\Users\Public\
8. Close AnyDesk and delete the executable
